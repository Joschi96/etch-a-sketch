This will be a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Initially 16x16 "pixels" wide canvas.

The canvas squares/"pixels" are created as flex-boxes and NOT set up as html grid for learning reasons.

Button on top can be used to change the amount of "pixels" per side.

Work in Progress
